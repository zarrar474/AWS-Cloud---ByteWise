AWS CloudFormation:

> A service that helps you model and set up resources
> Less time wasted on managing resources
> Create a template for AWS resources
> CloudFormation takes care of provisioning and configuring resources

Infrastructure Management:

> For a Web App
> Auto Scaling group
> Elastic Load Balancing load balancer
> Amazon Relational Database
> Provison and creation of resources
> All these tasks can add complexity 
> Instead,  create a CloudFormation template
> The template describes all resources 
> When you use that template to create a CloudFormation stack, CloudFormation provisions the Auto Scaling group, load balancer, and database 
> After the creation of the stack you're aws resources are up and running 
> Stacks can easily be deleted (will delete a;; the resources as well)
> CloudFomation allows you to manage all the resources as one unit

Replicate your infrastructure:

> For additonal availablility 
> you have to replicate it in multipke regions
> Have to replicate your resources
> Provision and configure those resources in each region
> Reuse your CloudFormation resources for other regions

Control and Track: 

> Underlying resources, need upgrade
> might need to roll back infrastructure to original settings
>  know what the original settings were
> Templates are text files
> When you provision your infrastructure with CloudFormation, the CloudFormation template describes exactly what resources are provisioned and their settings
