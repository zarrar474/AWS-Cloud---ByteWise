AWS Regions & Zones

> Hosted in multiple locations world-wide (Regions, Availability Zones, Local Zones, Outposts, Wavelenght Zones)
> Availiability Zones: Multiple, isolated locations in each region
> Local Zones: Provide ability to place resources eg compute and storage, in locations closer to user
> AWS Outposts: Brings AWS services, infrastructure to any data center
> Wavelenght Zones: Allows to develop and build applications, wavelenght deploys standard AWS compute and storage services

1. Regions: regions are isolated from other regionsfor greater fault tolerance and stability
> your resources are specified to your region
> When you launch an instance, you must select an AMI that's in the same Region
> If the AMI is in another Region, you can copy the AMI to the Region you're using

Available Regions: 
An AWS account provides multiple Regions so that you can launch Amazon EC2 instances in locations that meet requirements

Regions and endpoints: 
When you work with an instance using the command line interface, you must specify its Regional endpoint
> Amazon EC2 console or the command line interface to determine which Regions are available for your account


Availibility Zones: 
Each Region has multiple, isolated locations known as Availability Zones
> you select a Region and a virtual private cloud (VPC)
> If you distribute your instances across multiple Availability Zones and one instance fails, you can design your application so that an instance in another Availability Zone can handle requests

AZ IDs: 
To coordinate Availability Zones across accounts, you must use the AZ ID, which is a unique and consistent identifier for an Availability Zone


Local Zones: 
A Local Zone is an extension of an AWS Region in geographic proximity to your users. Local Zones have their own connections to the internet and support

Wavelength Zones: 
AWS Wavelength enables developers to build applications that deliver ultra-low latencies to mobile devices and end users

AWS Outposts: 
AWS Outposts is a fully managed service that extends AWS infrastructure, services, APIs, and tools to customer premises
