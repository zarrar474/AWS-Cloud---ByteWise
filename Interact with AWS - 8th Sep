Ways to Interact with AWS Services: 

1. AWS Console:
> Web Based GUI (Console to launch EC2 instances, can view info about IP addresses) 
> Instance is terminated once finished
> The console screen will be showing all AWS services
> Ability to Pin to the menu bar
> Can see the AWS Region
> Account Info
> AWS billing and management console

AWS CLI:
> allows to manage the enviornment using a terminal
> not quicker than the GUI
> Scripting CLI commands
> All AWS commands start with "aws" (ec2,s2,rds)
> run a single instance using a specific Amazon Machine Image (AMI), with an instance size of ‘t2.micro’ and using a key pair named ‘MainKey’

AWS SDKs: 
> Real power in programmability and automation
> A number of Software Development Kits (Interact through code)
> To intergrate AWS services into the applications 

CloudFormation: 
> tool used to define infrastructure as code
> quickly and in a repeatable manner
> your infrastructure is defined as code
> extremely flexible and powerful, allowing you to use many advanced features
