# 1. What is AWS Well-Architecture Framework, Describe Extensively along with benefits?

AWS Well-Architected helps cloud architects build secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure
It is basically a way to evaluate your architecture
*Well-Architected Framework includes domain-specific lenses, hands-on labs, and the AWS Well-Architected Tool (NO COST)*
This tool provides a mechanism for regularly evaluating workloads, identifying high-risk issues, and recording improvements

- Operational Excellence: 
*Designing with operations in mind, adapting to issues*
Runing Workloads effectively and improving procedures
1. Perform operations as code
2. make frequent changes
3. Anticipate failure
4. Learn from failures

- Security:
*protecting data and systems in the cloud*
1. you should have a strong identity foundation
2. Enable traceability
2. Should have layers if security
3. increase automation
4. encryption
5. Prepare for security failures

- Reliability: 
*Should perform well even if demand is increased, aritechture should be as per requirement*
1. Auto recover from failure (auto scaling)
2. Test your recovery procedures
3. inrease aggregate workload availability (scale horizontally )
4. Do not guess capacity
5. Manage change in automation

- Performance Efficiency: 
*Ability to scale, change according to demand*
1. New techology use
2. Go global quickly
3. use server less architectures
4. Experiment
5. prepare for mechanical failure and sympathy

- Cost Optimization: 
*Maximum business output while having minimum cost*
1. Implement Cloud Financial Management
2. Adopt a consumption model
3. Measure overall efficiency
4. Analyze expenditure


# 2. How can you be innovative on AWS?

- Amazon Culture of Innovation : Amazon has a peculiar approach to innovation that is intrinsically linked to how we use technology, and organise our teams
*90% of the new features were a direct result of feedback from AWS customers*
The Cloud Innovation Centers (CIC) Program provides an opportunity for nonprofits, education institutions, and government agencies to collaborate with other public sector organizations on their most pressing challenges, test new ideas with Amazonâ€™s innovation process, and access the technology expertise of Amazon Web Services (AWS)
