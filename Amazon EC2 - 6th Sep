Introduction

    EC2 is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud (Elastic Cloud Compute)
    Makes scaling easier
    
EC2 : FLexible, Cost-effective, Quick
    Better than on-premise data centers
    Amazon EC2, already built, secured datacenters, already online ready for use
    You only pay for what you use, Host is shared
Multitenancy: Sharing underlying hardware between virtual machines (Hypervisor)
More flexiblilty and control

    You can use your own OS, and our own software can run on EC2

Types of Instances (EC2):
    Each EC2 instance type is grouped under an instance family, for certain types of tasks 
    1. General purpose: Balanced Resources
    2. Compute optimized: Compute intensive tasks (gaming servers) (HPC)
    3. Memory optimized: Good for  memory intensive tasks
    4. Accelerated Computing: Floating point number calculations, graphics processing etc
    5. Storages Optimized: High perfmance for locally stored data

EC2 Scaling: Optimized and adapts to your needs, Scaling is about only using the resources that you need.                                    
Coustomers never lose service (Scalability and Elasticity) 

EC2 Auto Scaling: Allows you to add or remove EC2 intances automatically

There are two approaches:

     Dynamic scaling: responds to changing demand
     Predictive scaling: schedules the number of instances based on a predicted demand

Dynamic and Predictive scaling can be combined to scale faster
Scale Up or Scale Down
Right amount of power for the process 
Add instances on demand
